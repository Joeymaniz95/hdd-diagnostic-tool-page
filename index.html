          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A hard drive diagnostic tool is software or an interactive guide that helps you identify what is wrong with a failing hard drive. It evaluates symptoms like spinning behavior, unusual sounds, SMART health status, and whether the drive is detected by the computer — then routes you to the safest recovery path or advises professional help when DIY is not possible."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Cloning first protects your data. Scanning or recovering files directly from a failing patient drive stresses it further and can permanently overwrite sectors that still contain recoverable data. By creating a full sector-level copy with ddrescue onto a healthy target drive, you preserve the original state and do all file recovery work from the copy — never the original."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Stop powering the drive on immediately. Clicking is a clear sign of a read/write head failure. Each additional power cycle risks the failed head dragging across the platter surface and scratching away your data. Software recovery tools cannot address this. Professional cleanroom head-stack replacement using a matched donor drive is required."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A non-spinning drive indicates PCB (circuit board) failure or a seized spindle motor. DIY PCB swaps require matching a donor board exactly and transferring the ROM chip — and on many drives manufactured after 2013, also transferring the MCU (microcontroller unit). Both require professional microsoldering or BGA rework equipment. Motor seizure requires cleanroom disassembly. Stop all power cycles and contact a professional."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "This pattern means the drive starts its startup sequence, attempts to initialize its read/write heads, fails, and shuts itself down as a self-protection mechanism. It indicates a head failure. Software tools like ddrescue cannot help because the drive powers down before any data transfer can begin. Professional cleanroom head replacement is required. Do not continue powering the drive on."

For external drives, the USB-to-SATA bridge inside the enclosure may be failing — try removing the drive from the enclosure and connecting it directly via SATA. If it still is not detected, firmware issues or deeper hardware failure may be present. Do not continue DIY attempts; professional evaluation is needed."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, as long as the internal drive has enough available free space. The critical rule is: never save recovered files to the cloned drive or the original patient drive. Your destination can be a separate external drive (recommended) or your computer's internal drive — either is acceptable as long as it is neither the clone nor the patient drive."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool that creates a sector-level copy of a failing drive onto a healthy target drive. It skips difficult sectors on the first pass to minimize stress on the failing drive, then retries them in a second pass. A log file tracks everything so the operation can be paused and resumed safely without re-copying already-transferred data. It runs from a bootable Linux environment such as SystemRescue."

After cloning your patient drive with ddrescue, you connect the cloned drive externally to your Windows machine and scan it with R-Studio to locate and recover deleted, lost, or inaccessible files. You always work from the clone — never from the original patient drive."

          <p>
            This page pairs the free interactive hard drive diagnostic tool above with a complete
            written recovery guide. The tool walks you through your drive's symptoms — how it sounds
            when powered on, whether it's detected, and what CrystalDiskInfo reports — then routes
            you to the safest course of action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The written guide covers everything the wizard teaches: how to identify your drive's
            failure type, how to create a bootable recovery USB on Windows, how to run a two-pass
            ddrescue clone, how to scan the clone with R-Studio, and — critically — when DIY
            recovery is no longer safe and professional cleanroom help is the only option.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central principle throughout is <strong style="color: var(--text);">clone first,
            recover from the copy.</strong> Running repair tools or file recovery software directly
            on a failing drive is one of the most common ways people permanently lose data they
            could have recovered.

            If the drive powers on, spins up, stays spinning, and is detected by the computer,
            there is a strong chance your data can be recovered with the DIY clone-first approach
            described here. The wizard will confirm this after you check the drive's health in
            CrystalDiskInfo. SMART status of Good or Caution means DIY recovery is worth attempting.

        <h2 id="stop-heading">When To Stop — Hard-Stop Conditions</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
          Five conditions require you to stop all DIY activity immediately. Software tools cannot
          help in any of these cases, and continued attempts will reduce — or permanently eliminate —
          the chance of successful professional recovery.
        </p>

        <!-- STOP 1: Not Spinning -->
        <div class="stop-card" role="region" aria-label="Hard stop: drive not spinning">
          <span class="stop-label">Hard Stop</span>
          <h3>Drive Is Not Spinning</h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 14px;">
            A drive that does not spin at all cannot be helped by any software tool. This is a
            hardware-level failure requiring professional equipment.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Most common cause — PCB failure:</strong> The printed circuit board (the green electronics board on the drive's underside) has failed. The motor never receives a start signal.</li>
            <li><strong>Also possible — seized spindle motor:</strong> The motor inside the drive has physically seized and cannot rotate the platters. Requires cleanroom disassembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Why DIY PCB swaps do not work:</strong> Every drive PCB contains a ROM chip storing unique adaptive calibration data for that specific drive. Swapping a donor board without transferring the ROM will fail — the drive will not recognize its own platters.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern drives (post-2013) add another complication:</strong> Many store adaptive data in the MCU (microcontroller unit) rather than a separate ROM chip. MCU transfer requires BGA rework equipment — far beyond any DIY capability.</li>
            <li><strong>If the ROM chip is physically damaged:</strong> Recovery may be impossible, even by professionals.</li>
            <li><strong>Motor seizure:</strong> Opening the drive to address this requires an ISO-5 certified cleanroom (10,000 times cleaner than typical indoor air). A single dust particle on the platters during disassembly can destroy all data permanently.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--danger);">
            Stop powering the drive on and off. Each power cycle applies stress to an already-failed
            component and can worsen the damage. Your data is very likely still on the platters —

          <h3>Drive Is Clicking</h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 14px;">
            Clicking is one of the clearest signs of a read/write head failure. The actuator arm
            is stuck in a loop: attempting to position the heads, failing, resetting, and trying
            again. This is a physical and mechanical failure — no software command can fix it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What is happening:</strong> One or more read/write heads have failed. The drive cannot complete its startup or find the data it is looking for.</li>
            <li><strong>Why each power cycle makes it worse:</strong> When a drive with a failed head spins up, the head can drag across the platter surface instead of floating above it. This physically scratches the magnetic coating where your data is stored. Even a single additional power cycle can reduce how much is recoverable.</li>
            <li><strong>Why software tools cannot help:</strong> ddrescue and R-Studio communicate with the drive through the operating system. If the heads cannot read the system area, the drive is either invisible to the OS or goes offline almost immediately. There is no software workaround for a hardware head failure.</li>
            <li><strong>What professional recovery involves:</strong> The head stack assembly is replaced in a certified cleanroom with a matched set from a compatible donor drive. Once working heads are installed, technicians image the drive sector by sector and extract your files.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 16px; font-weight: 700; color: var(--danger);">
            Stop powering the drive on. Do not run scans or cloning attempts. Do not open the
            drive outside a cleanroom. Contact a professional immediately — the fewer additional
            power cycles, the better your chances.

          <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 14px;">
            The drive starts its startup sequence, attempts to initialize the read/write heads,
            fails, and shuts itself down to avoid further damage. This is the drive's built-in
            self-protection mechanism activating.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Most common cause:</strong> One or more read/write heads have failed and cannot read the drive's internal system area. Without reading that information, startup cannot complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Why software tools cannot help:</strong> ddrescue and R-Studio need the drive to stay online and stable. This drive powers down before any data transfer can begin — there is nothing for the software to work with.</li>
            <li><strong>Why continued power cycles cause more damage:</strong> Every spin-up attempt forces the failing heads across the platters. Each attempt risks scratching the magnetic surface where your data is stored.</li>
            <li><strong>What is required:</strong> Cleanroom head stack replacement using a precisely matched compatible donor drive.</li>

            <li><strong style="color: #93c5fd;">Cause 1 — Failing USB-to-SATA bridge:</strong> External USB drives contain a bridge board that converts the SATA signal to USB. If this bridge is failing, the drive may not be detected even though the drive itself is fine. Try bypassing the enclosure and connecting the drive directly via SATA. If it appears via direct SATA, the bridge was the problem.</li>
            <li><strong style="color: #93c5fd;">Cause 2 — Firmware or translation issue:</strong> Internal firmware problems can prevent the drive from identifying correctly, even on a direct SATA connection. Firmware-level diagnosis and recovery requires professional tools.</li>

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 14px;">
          <h3>What is ddrescue?</h3>
          <p>
            GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool that creates a sector-level copy of a failing
            drive onto a healthy target drive. Unlike a regular file copy, ddrescue skips
            difficult sectors on the first pass to avoid prolonged stress, then retries them in
            a targeted second pass. It saves a log file so the operation can be safely paused and
            resumed without re-copying data already transferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            ddrescue runs from a bootable Linux environment. This guide uses SystemRescue, which
            includes ddrescue pre-installed. It does not run from within Windows.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--text-dim); font-size: 13px; margin-top: 8px;">
            Note: the commands below are examples. Always verify the correct device names on your
            specific machine using <code>lsblk</code> before running either command.
          </p>

          <h4>⛔ Critical — Do Not Mix Up Patient and Target</h4>
          <p style="color: #fca5a5; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 15px;">
            In the commands below, <code>sdX</code> is always the <strong>patient drive</strong>
            (source — your failing drive). <code>sdY</code> is always the <strong>target drive</strong>
            (destination — your empty clone drive). <strong>Reversing these two arguments will
            completely and permanently erase your patient drive.</strong> ddrescue starts immediately
            with no confirmation prompt. Confirm device names with <code>lsblk</code> first.

        <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 14px;">
          <h3>Pass 1 — Fast Copy (No Retries)</h3>
          <p>
            Run this first. It copies all readable sectors quickly and skips sectors that are
            difficult to read, minimizing the number of times the failing drive is stressed.
            Let it run until it finishes on its own — do not interrupt it.
          </p>

            <li><code>-f</code> — Force overwrite of the target (required when writing to a whole disk device).</li>
            <li><code>-n</code> — No scraping: skip bad sectors on this pass rather than retrying them.</li>
            <li><code>rescue.log</code> — Progress log file. Tracks which sectors have been copied. Enables safe pause and resume.</li>

          <h3>Pass 2 — Retry Difficult Sectors</h3>
          <p>
            After Pass 1 finishes, run this second command. It targets only the sectors that
            could not be read during Pass 1. The same <code>rescue.log</code> is reused —
            ddrescue resumes exactly where it left off. This pass can take many hours or days
            on a heavily damaged drive.

            <li>If ddrescue appears stuck on one sector for 30 minutes or more, you can safely press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and run Pass 2 directly — it will retry those stuck areas.</li>
            <li>If the patient drive disconnects mid-clone, stop ddrescue (<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>), reconnect it firmly, and run the same command again. The log file enables safe resume without re-copying already-transferred data.</li>
            <li>If the patient drive begins clicking loudly during cloning, stop immediately, disconnect the patient drive, and contact a professional recovery lab.</li>
            <li>The target drive must be the same size or larger than the patient drive. Even drives advertised with the same capacity from different manufacturers may differ by a few gigabytes.</li>
            <li>Keep your laptop plugged in throughout — a power loss mid-clone may require restarting from the beginning.</li>

              <summary>Why should I clone the drive before recovering files?</summary>
              <p>Scanning or recovering files directly from a failing patient drive stresses it further and can permanently overwrite sectors still containing recoverable data. Cloning first with ddrescue creates a stable copy you can work from repeatedly. All file recovery happens on the clone — the original patient drive is never touched again after cloning.</p>

              <summary>What should I do if my hard drive is clicking?</summary>
              <p>Stop powering the drive on immediately. Clicking is a clear sign of a read/write head failure. Each additional power cycle risks the failed head dragging across the platter surface and permanently scratching away data. Software recovery tools cannot address a hardware head failure. Professional cleanroom head-stack replacement using a matched donor drive is required.</p>

              <summary>What should I do if my hard drive is not spinning?</summary>
              <p>A non-spinning drive indicates PCB (circuit board) failure or a seized spindle motor. DIY PCB swaps require matching a donor board exactly and transferring the ROM chip — and on many modern drives, the MCU. Both require professional microsoldering or BGA rework equipment. Motor seizure requires cleanroom disassembly. Stop all power cycles and contact a professional recovery service.</p>

          <li class="faq-item">
            <details>
              <summary>What if my drive spins up then spins down?</summary>
              <p>This means the drive's startup sequence is failing because the read/write heads cannot initialize. The drive shuts itself down as a self-protection mechanism. Software tools cannot help because the drive powers down before any data transfer can begin. Professional cleanroom head replacement is required. Do not continue powering the drive on.</p>

            <details>
              <summary>What if my drive is not detected in CrystalDiskInfo?</summary>
              <p>If the drive does not appear, the computer is not communicating with it. For external drives, remove the drive from the enclosure and try connecting it directly via SATA — the USB bridge may be failing. If it still does not appear via SATA, firmware issues or deeper hardware failure are likely. Do not continue DIY attempts; professional evaluation is needed.</p>

            <details>
              <summary>Can I save recovered files to my computer's internal drive?</summary>
              <p>Yes, as long as the internal drive has enough available free space. The critical rule is: never save recovered files to the cloned drive or the original patient drive. A separate external drive is the recommended destination, but your internal drive is also valid if it has sufficient space — as long as it is neither the clone nor the patient.</p>

              <summary>What is ddrescue and how does it differ from a regular copy?</summary>
              <p>GNU ddrescue creates a sector-level image of a failing drive onto a healthy target. Unlike a file copy, it skips problematic sectors on the first pass to minimize stress, retries them in a second pass, and saves a log file so the process can be paused and resumed safely. It is designed specifically to extract the maximum amount of data from a damaged drive.</p>

            <details>
              <summary>What does "Bad" in CrystalDiskInfo mean?</summary>
              <p>A Bad SMART status means one or more of the drive's critical health attributes have exceeded their failure threshold — for example, too many reallocated sectors or pending uncorrectable errors. The drive is actively failing. Continuing DIY recovery on a drive in this state can permanently destroy data that would otherwise be recoverable. Professional recovery is strongly recommended.</p>

            <details>
              <summary>Should I run CHKDSK to try to fix my drive?</summary>
              <p>Never run CHKDSK on the original patient drive. CHKDSK writes to the drive, which can overwrite recoverable sectors and corrupt the file system structures that recovery software relies on. If CHKDSK is needed at all, run it only on the cloned copy after the clone is complete — never on the original failing drive.</p>

          <li class="faq-item">
            <details>
              <summary>What are the signs that professional recovery is needed?</summary>
              <p>Seek professional help if: ddrescue recovered less than 50% of the drive after both passes; R-Studio shows a blank, empty, or heavily corrupted file structure; the drive was clicking, beeping, or grinding at any point; the drive is not recognized by the computer; or CrystalDiskInfo reports Bad health. All of these indicate physical or firmware-level failure beyond the reach of DIY software tools.</p>
